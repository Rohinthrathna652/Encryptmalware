# Encryption Malware for Educational Purposes

## Introduction

This repository contains a demonstration of encryption malware developed for educational purposes. The inspiration for this project comes from the series "Mr. Robot," specifically Season 1, where a similar type of malware is used to encrypt files at EvilCorp. This code is intended to illustrate basic principles of encryption and malware behavior and should not be used for any malicious activities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on example of how encryption can be implemented in malware. By studying this code, learners can gain a better understanding of:

- Basic encryption techniques
- How malware can encrypt files
- The implications and risks associated with ransomware-like behavior

## Usage

### Important Warning

**This code is for educational purposes only. Running this code on your system or network can have serious consequences, including data loss. Ensure you run it in a controlled and isolated environment (such as a virtual machine) to avoid any unintended damage.**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (if any)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohinthrathna652/Encryptmalware.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Encryptmalware
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install cyptography
   ```

### Running the Code

To execute the script, use the following command:
```bash
python3 ransomware.py    
 
python3 decryptor.py
```

### Testing

For safe testing, use a dedicated virtual machine or sandbox environment. Verify the behavior of the malware without affecting any critical files or systems.
